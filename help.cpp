      "        they appeared in place of the call to the macro.  Here's a "

      "        version of REPEAT:\n"

      "        Even in the base case, MY.REPEAT outputs an empty instruction\n"
      "        list.  To show how MY.REPEAT works, let's take the example\n"
      "\n"
      "                my.repeat 5 [print \"hello]\n"
      "\n"
      "        For this example, MY.REPEAT will output the instruction list\n"
